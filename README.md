# Record-Keyinput-Quaver
A small plugin for Quaver that allows note input from keypresses.

# How to use
Copy files into plugins folder in Quaver

This plugin only works for four key charts. Additionally, I am not sure if there is a hook for controls, so to create notes you must use the keys "df jk". 
If you want to modify it, feel free to! This is my first Quaver plugin, and so there is a lot that could be improved.
